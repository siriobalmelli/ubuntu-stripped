Description: Stipped-down Ubuntu Server
	Remove all unnecessary packages and services for a stripped (minimalist)
	Ubuntu server/VM installation, that doesn't have any:
	- tracking/reporting to Canonical
	- Wifi and ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 support
	- Unused DBUS services (like accounts, etc)
	- laptop-specific features
	- dumbed-down firewalls (e.g. ufw) ... real admins use iptables or nftables
	- useless bits and bobs (iSCSI, anyone?)

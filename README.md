# ubuntu-stripped

This is a Debian package which strips all unnecessary packages
    and services from a Server (CLI) install.

The goal is an Ubuntu server/VM installation that doesn't have any:

- tracking/reporting to Canonical
- Wifi and ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 support
- Unused DBUS services (like accounts, etc)
- laptop-specific features
- dumbed-down firewalls (e.g. ufw) ... real admins use iptables or nftables

## Installing
